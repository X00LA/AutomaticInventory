## Note from BigScary (Original developer)
I created this Minecraft server plugin using the Bukkit API to minimize the pain of inventory management.  It automatically sorts player and chest inventories, intelligently deposits player loot into correct containers, and auto-refills hotbar slots when players use the last item in a stack (or break a tool!) but have more of the same in their backpacks.
